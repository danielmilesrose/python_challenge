Python Challenge for Module 3 -- UC Berkeley Data Analysis 

In this challenge, we use Python to sort through two CSVs to extract data.

In the first part of the challenge, we use code to iterate through a CSV to analyze a company's financial records.
We have created a code to loop through the CSV and collect various datapoints, such as how much the company
made in total over a given time period.  We also use this code to identify the month in which the greatest
gains/losses occurred.  This program will also create and print the findings in a separate text file.

In the second part of the challenge, we have created a code to scan a CSV containing votes in an election,
and collect that data to determine how many votes each candidate received and who the winner of the election was.

In part two, some code/methods were sourced from https://www.tutorialspoint.com/count-frequencies-of-all-elements-in-array-in-python and https://www.entechin.com/how-to-find-the-max-value-in-a-dictionary-in-python/?expand_article=1
